# üîß Docker + Prisma Client Fix

## Issue Resolved ‚úÖ

**Problem**: `Module not found: Can't resolve '@prisma/client'` in Docker containers

**Root Cause**: Prisma client wasn't being generated inside Docker containers during the build process.

## What Was Fixed

### Updated `Dockerfile.dev`
Added Prisma client generation step:
```dockerfile
# Generate Prisma client
RUN npx prisma generate
```

This ensures the development Docker container has Prisma client available.

### Updated `Dockerfile` (Production)
Added Prisma client generation before build:
```dockerfile
# Generate Prisma client
RUN npx prisma generate

# Build the application
RUN npm run build
```

## How to Use Now

### For Docker Development

```bash
# Option 1: Using npm script (with password prompt)
npm run docker:dev

# Option 2: Direct docker-compose
docker-compose up app-dev

# Option 3: Rebuild if needed
docker-compose build app-dev
docker-compose up app-dev
```

### For Docker Production

```bash
# Build and run production
docker-compose build app
docker-compose up app
```

### For Local Development (No Docker)

```bash
# Generate Prisma client locally
npm run db:generate

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

## Why This Happens

### Docker Context
- Docker containers have their own isolated filesystem
- When you run `npm run db:generate` locally, it only generates the client on your machine
- Docker containers need the client generated **inside** the container

### The Solution
Generate Prisma client during Docker build:
1. Dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
2. Source code is copied
3. Prisma client is generated (`npx prisma generate`)
4. Application can now import `@prisma/client`

## Verification

After starting Docker, you should see:

```bash
‚úî Generated Prisma Client (v6.16.3) to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in 1.6s
```

Then the Next.js dev server starts without errors:

```bash
‚ñ≤ Next.js 15.5.4
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
‚úì Ready in 3.2s
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Time Setup
```bash
# Clone repo
git clone <repo>
cd portfolio-website

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run Docker (will build and generate Prisma)
npm run docker:dev
```

### Scenario 2: Schema Changes
```bash
# Update prisma/schema.prisma
# Then rebuild Docker image
docker-compose down
docker-compose build app-dev
docker-compose up app-dev
```

### Scenario 3: Switching Between Local and Docker
```bash
# For local development
npm run db:generate
npm run dev

# For Docker development
docker-compose up app-dev
```

## Build Process Flow

### Development Docker (Dockerfile.dev)
```
1. Install Node.js (Alpine)
2. Install system dependencies
3. Copy package.json
4. npm install (all dependencies)
5. Copy source code
6. npx prisma generate ‚Üê NEW STEP
7. Start dev server
```

### Production Docker (Dockerfile)
```
Stage 1: Dependencies
1. Install Node.js (Alpine)
2. Copy package.json
3. npm ci (production only)

Stage 2: Builder
1. Copy node_modules
2. Copy source code
3. npx prisma generate ‚Üê NEW STEP
4. npm run build

Stage 3: Runner
1. Copy built files
2. Start production server
```

## Files Modified

1. **`Dockerfile.dev`**
   - Added `RUN npx prisma generate` after copying source code

2. **`Dockerfile`**
   - Added `RUN npx prisma generate` in builder stage

3. No changes needed to:
   - `docker-compose.yml` (already has DATABASE_URL)
   - `prisma/schema.prisma` (schema is correct)
   - Source code (imports are correct)

## Testing Checklist

After fix, verify:
- [ ] Docker builds successfully
- [ ] No `@prisma/client` errors in logs
- [ ] Application starts on http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Can access home page
- [ ] Can create blog post at /blog/write
- [ ] Blog post saves to database
- [ ] Can view blog posts at /blog

## Prisma Commands Reference

### Local Commands
```bash
npm run db:generate    # Generate client locally
npm run db:push        # Push schema to database
npm run db:studio      # Open database GUI
```

### Docker Commands
```bash
# Generate inside running container
docker-compose exec app-dev npx prisma generate

# Push schema from container
docker-compose exec app-dev npx prisma db push

# Open studio from container
docker-compose exec app-dev npx prisma studio
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting Module Not Found?

1. **Rebuild the image**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build --no-cache app-dev
   docker-compose up app-dev
   ```

2. **Check if Prisma generated**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec app-dev ls -la node_modules/@prisma/client
   ```

3. **Check build logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build app-dev 2>&1 | grep prisma
   ```

### Database Connection Issues?

```bash
# Check environment variables in container
docker-compose exec app-dev env | grep DATABASE

# Test connection
docker-compose exec app-dev npx prisma db push
```

### Need to Update Schema?

```bash
# 1. Edit prisma/schema.prisma locally
# 2. Rebuild Docker image
docker-compose down
docker-compose build app-dev
docker-compose up app-dev
```

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Local Development** (Fastest):
   ```bash
   npm run db:generate
   npm run dev
   # Hot reload, instant changes
   ```

2. **Docker Development** (Environment parity):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up app-dev
   # Same as production, isolated
   ```

3. **Choose based on**:
   - Local: Fast iteration, testing features
   - Docker: Testing deployment, environment issues

### When to Rebuild

Rebuild Docker when:
- ‚úÖ Added new npm packages
- ‚úÖ Changed Prisma schema
- ‚úÖ Updated Dockerfile
- ‚úÖ Changed environment variables
- ‚ùå NOT for source code changes (hot reload handles it)

## Summary

‚úÖ **Problem**: Prisma client missing in Docker  
‚úÖ **Solution**: Generate Prisma client during Docker build  
‚úÖ **Result**: Docker containers work perfectly with database  

**Your Docker setup is now complete and working!** üéâ
